Scala.js Electron Skeleton with ReactJS
=======================================

This is an example of how to use Scala.js together with Electron to build native applications.

## Getting started
Get started, start sbt and launch the electronMain task
``` bash
sbt
sbt> ~electronMain
```

Then you will need to get Electron [downloaded](https://github.com/atom/electron/releases)  on your machine.

Once you do, call the Electron executable with the electron-app subfolder as a argument:
``` bash
/your/path/to/Electron electron-app
# e.g. on my MacOS machine
~/development/tools/electron-v1.1.1-darwin-x64/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron electron-app/
```

You should see a new window opening with the following text:
> Hello World!
>
>We are using node.js v6.1.0 and Electron 1.1.1.
>
>Hello World from Scala.js

## Main process
Sbt task `electronMain` aggregates the content of `fastOptJS` and of the launcher to form the `main.js` file that will be provided to Electron's main process. This is why the repo does not contain a `main.js` under the `electron-app` folder (unlike electron's quick start example): it is generated from the Scala.js code.

Electron's [main process]((http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/)) is implemented by [com.example.electronapp.Main.scala](https://github.com/bchazalet/scalajs-electron-skeleton/blob/master/scalajs/src/main/scala/com/example/electronapp/Main.scala). It extends `js.App` and that's what the generated Scala.js launcher launches. You should not extend `js.App` elsewhere in your code or that will generate a conflict: instead use `JSExport`.

If for some reason, you don't want the `main.js` to come from Scala.js, see the [simple-main-js](https://github.com/bchazalet/scalajs-electron-skeleton/tree/simple-main-js) branch where the main file is exactly the one from Electron's quick start example, written in pure javascript.

## Renderer process
The javascript code loaded from within the rendered process (i.e. `index.html`) is implemented in [com.example.electronapp.Renderer.scala](https://github.com/bchazalet/scalajs-electron-skeleton/blob/master/scalajs/src/main/scala/com/example/electronapp/Renderer.scala) and uses the `JSExport` annotation to be callable from javascript and its main method is explicitly called from within `index.html`.
